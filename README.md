# The Story of Your Time

This is a simple life simulator using the OpenAI API that predicts a person's life timeline from birth to death based on their profile information. The result is then converted into a loose animation using a stick figure.

## Installation
This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), but you can also use npm or yarn.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# or
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the page.

## Usage

Enter your profile (or any information you like) into the form on the first page, then press the "Let's Start" button. The generated script and animation will be displayed on the next screen.
